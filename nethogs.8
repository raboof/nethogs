.SH DESCRIPTION
NetHogs is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down per protocol or per subnet, like most such tools do, it groups bandwidth by process - and does not rely on a special kernel module to be loaded. So if there's suddenly a lot of network traffic, you can fire up NetHogs and immediately see which PID is causing this, and if it's some kind of spinning process, kill it.
